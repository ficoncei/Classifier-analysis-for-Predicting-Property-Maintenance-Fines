# Classifier-analysis-for-Predicting-Property-Maintenance-Fines

One of the most pressing problems in Detroit is blight. Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the question can be posed: how can blight ticket compliance be increased?

The code presented in this repository analyses the available datasets and creates different classifiers to predict the probability that a new fine will be paid or not on time.

The data available in the datasets has been provided through the Detroit Open Data Portal.

Two data files are used in training and validating the models: train.csv and test.csv. Each row in these two files corresponds to a single blight ticket, and includes information about when, why, and to whom each ticket was issued. The target variable is compliance, which is True if the ticket was paid early, on time, or within one month of the hearing data, False if the ticket was paid after the hearing date or not at all, and Null if the violator was found not responsible. A thorough description of the fields in the dataset can be found at the bottom of this readme file.
